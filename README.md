# Visualization Project
This is a visualization project focusing on prevalence of disabilities/chronic conditions across America. 

# Inspiration 
I was inspired to do this project because I have a chronic ACL tear, which has slowly devolved into a disabling condition. 
It's been an incredibly isolating experience, and I wanted to use my data analysis skills to feel less alone.
I found this is a really interesting project as I was able to explore associations between certain types of disabilities and demographic traits such as age, region, and income level. 
I learnt a lot about visualizing different types of data throughout this experience and feel much more confident about my ability to accurately determine what type of graph is best to use for each type of data.

# Dataset information 
This dataset was taken from Waves 1-11 of the National Health & Aging Trends Study (https://www.nhats.org/). 
My subset included 3817 observations and 40 variables. 

# Visualization PDF
